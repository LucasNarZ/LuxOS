# LuxOS

This is an experimental operating system project.  
Currently, it only includes a bootloader configured with GRUB, serving as the foundation for future development.  

The goal of this project is to explore low-level programming, operating system design, and build features step by step from scratch.  

Stay tuned for upcoming updates!
